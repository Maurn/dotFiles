;;; Commentary:
;;; Emacs Startup File --- initialization for Emacs
;;; Code:

;; Emacs HEAD (27+) introduces early-init.el, which is run before init.el,
;; before package and UI initialization happens.

;; Defer garbage collection further back in the startup process
(setq gc-cons-threshold most-positive-fixnum)

;; In Emacs 27+, package initialization occurs before `user-init-file' is
;; loaded, but after `early-init-file'. Doom handles package initialization, so
;; we must prevent Emacs from doing it early!
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
;; (advice-add #'package--ensure-init-file :override #'ignore)

;; Resizing the Emacs frame can be a terribly expensive part of changing the
;; font. By inhibiting this, we easily halve startup times with fonts that are
;; larger than the system default.
